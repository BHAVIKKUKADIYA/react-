here we do a props drilling

theme and setTheme in app.jsx padd in navabar 
theme={theme} 

also navbar in nav2 use
also use navabar in props.theme and props.setTheme
this is pass in nav2 in theme={props.theme} setTheme={props.setTheme}
** This is childern in props drilling is complex and difficult so we have to use a context api

next create the context folder inside ThemeContext.jsx 
with wrap app in main.jsx import and wrap 
  <ThemeContext>
    <App />
  </ThemeContext>,
  here are the this is a parent of the app 




  Navbar theme={theme}>
      <h2>THis is  navbar</h2>
      <h2>THis is  afshasdj</h2>
     </Navbar>
     child pn show like console in object
     more than one show in araray
     ex.. (2) [{…}, {…}]


props in jagya ae children use kaariye to ditrect use kari sakiye
exx.. function Navbar({children,theme})
here pass childeren and theme so we have directly use the this
           {children}
            <Nav2 theme={theme}/>
not reuired props.____ pass reuired dirctly use
this how childeren usefull
